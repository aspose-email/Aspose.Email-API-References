## Identity class

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/identity?view=graph-rest-1.0<br/>            The Identity resource represents an identity of an actor. <br/>            For example, an actor can be a user, device, or application.

The Identity type exposes the following members:
## Constructors
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|Identity()|Initializes a new instance of the Identity class|
## Properties
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|display_name|The identity's display name. <br/>            Note that this may not always be available or up to date. <br/>            For example, if a user changes their display name, the API may show the new value in a future response, <br/>            but the items associated with the user won't show up as having changed when using delta.|
|id|Unique identifier for the identity.|
|thumbnails|The ThumbnailSet resource is a keyed collection of thumbnail resources.|

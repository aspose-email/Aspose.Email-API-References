## SocksVersion enumeration

Versions of the SOCKS protocol

## Members
| Member name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|SOCKS_V4|SOCKS4 and SOCKS4a version <br/>            SOCKS4a extends the SOCKS4 protocol to allow a client to specify a destination domain name rather than an IPv4 address; <br/>            this is useful when the client itself cannot resolve the destination host's domain name to an IP address.|
|SOCKS_V5|SOCKS5 version <br/>            The SOCKS5 protocol is defined in RFC 1928. It is an extension of the SOCKS4 protocol; <br/>            it offers more choices for authentication, and adds support for IPv6 and UDP, the latter of which can be used for DNS lookups.|

|kind|Type of the resource|
|e_tag|An ETag or entity tag is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for web cache validation, and which allows a client to make conditional requests. <br/>            This allows caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. <br/>            ETags can also be used for optimistic concurrency control, as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other.|
|id|Identifier of the resource.|
|summary|Title of the calendar.|
|description|Description of the calendar.|
|location|Geographic location of the calendar as free-form text.|
|time_zone|The time zone of the calendar.|
|conference_properties|Gets conferencing properties for this calendar.|
|CALENDAR_KIND|Type of the resource "calendar#calendar".|

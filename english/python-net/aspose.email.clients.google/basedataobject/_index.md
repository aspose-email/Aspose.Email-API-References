## Properties
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|kind|Type of the resource|
|e_tag|An ETag or entity tag is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for web cache validation, and which allows a client to make conditional requests. <br/>            This allows caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. <br/>            ETags can also be used for optimistic concurrency control, as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other.|
|id|Identifier of the resource.|

## IActivityClient.ListContent method (1 of 2)

This operation lists the content currently available for retrieval for the specified content type. The content is an aggregation of actions and events harvested from multiple servers across multiple datacenters. The content will be listed in the order in which the aggregations become available, but the events and actions within the aggregations are not guaranteed to be sequential. By default, when startTime and endTime are omitted, then the content available in the last 24 hours is returned.

```csharp
public ContentInfo[] ListContent(string contentType)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contentType | String | Indicates the content type. |

## Return Value

List of available information about activity

The content will be listed in the order in which the aggregations become available, but the events and actions within the aggregations are not guaranteed to be sequential.

```csharp

```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contentType | String | Indicates the content type. |
| startTime | Nullable`1 | Optional datetimes (UTC) indicating the time range of content to return, based on when the content became available. The time range is inclusive with respect to startTime (startTime less or equal contentCreated), so that non-overlapping, incrementing time intervals can used to page through available content. Both (startTime and endTime) must be specified (or both omitted). Time range must be no more than 24 hours apart, with the start time no more than 7 days in the past. |
| endTime | Nullable`1 | Optional datetimes (UTC) indicating the time range of content to return, based on when the content became available. The time range is exclusive with respect to endTime (contentCreated less endTime), so that non-overlapping, incrementing time intervals can used to page through available content. Both (startTime and endTime) must be specified (or both omitted) Time range must be no more than 24 hours apart, with the start time no more than 7 days in the past. |

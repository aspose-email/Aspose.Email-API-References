| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| virtual [ETag](../../aspose.email.clients.google/basedataobject/etag/) { get; set; } | An ETag or entity tag is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for web cache validation, and which allows a client to make conditional requests. This allows caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. ETags can also be used for optimistic concurrency control, as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other. |
| virtual [Id](../../aspose.email.clients.google/basedataobject/id/) { get; set; } | Identifier of the resource. |
| virtual [Kind](../../aspose.email.clients.google/basedataobject/kind/) { get; } | Type of the resource |

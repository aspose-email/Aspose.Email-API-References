## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SortConditions](sortconditions)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ReverseBy](reverseby) { get; set; } | Gets or sets reverse sort criteria Followed by another sort criterion, has the effect of that criterion but in reverse(descending) order. Note: REVERSE only reverses a single criterion, and does not affect the implicit "sequence number" sort criterion if all other criteria are identical. Consequently, a sort of REVERSE SUBJECT is not the same as a reverse ordering of a SUBJECT sort. This can be avoided by use of additional criteria, e.g., SUBJECT DATE vs. REVERSE SUBJECT REVERSE DATE. In general, however, it's better (and faster, if the client has a "reverse current ordering" command) to reverse the results in the client instead of issuing a new SORT. |
| [SortBy](sortby) { get; set; } | Gets or sets sort criteria |

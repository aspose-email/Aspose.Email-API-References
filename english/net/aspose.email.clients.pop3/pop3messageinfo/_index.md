## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| virtual [Bcc](../../aspose.email.clients/messageinfobase/bcc) { get; } | Gets blind carbon copy of the E-Mail message. |
| virtual [CC](../../aspose.email.clients/messageinfobase/cc) { get; } | Gets CC of the E-Mail message. |
| virtual [Date](../../aspose.email.clients/messageinfobase/date) { get; } | The origination date specifies the date and time at which the creator of the message indicated that the message was complete and ready to enter the mail delivery system. For instance, this might be the time that a user pushes the "send" or "submit" button in an application program. In any case, it is specifically not intended to convey the time that the message is actually transported, but rather the time at which the human or other creator of the message has put the message into its final form, ready for transport. (For example, a portable computer user who is not connected to a network might queue a message for delivery. The origination date is intended to contain the date and time that the user queued the message, not the time when the user connected to the network to send the message.) |

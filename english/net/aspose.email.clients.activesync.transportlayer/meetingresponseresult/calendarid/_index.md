## MeetingResponseResult.CalendarId property

Specifies the server ID of the calendar item. The CalendarId element value can be up to 64 characters in length. The CalendarId element is included in the MeetingResponse command response that is sent to the client if the meeting request was not declined. If the meeting is accepted or tentatively accepted, the server adds a new item to the calendar and returns its server ID in the CalendarId element in the response. If the client created a tentative meeting calendar item, the client updates that item with the new server ID. The client also changes the busy status from tentative to busy. When a meeting is accepted, the server also creates a new calendar item with the same server ID. This means there is a conflict that will be resolved the next time the calendar is synchronized. If the meeting is declined, the response does not contain a CalendarId element.

```csharp
public string CalendarId { get; set; }
```

description: Specifies whether to include items that are included within the conversation modality within the results of the Sync response. Setting the ConversationMode element value to TRUE results in retrieving all emails that match the conversations received within the date filter specified. However although the body of the emails outside of that time based filter will not be retrieved the text previews will be retrieved if the previews were requested.Setting the ConversationMode element value to FALSE in a Sync request results in the synchronization of items that meet the criteria of the FilterType element section 2.2.3.64 value. Setting the ConversationMode element value to TRUE expands the result set to also include any items with identical email2ConversationId MSASEMAIL section 2.2.2.14 values to those in the FilterType result set. The ConversationMode element value has no impact on items outside the collection specified by the CollectionId element section 2.2.3.30.5 the result set is always limited to items in the specified collection. The ConversationMode element value only limits or expands the results determined by the FilterType element value.

However, although the body of the emails outside of that time based filter will not be retrieved, the text previews will be retrieved if the previews were requested.Setting the ConversationMode element value to FALSE in a Sync request results in the synchronization of items that meet the criteria of the FilterType element (section 2.2.3.64) value.

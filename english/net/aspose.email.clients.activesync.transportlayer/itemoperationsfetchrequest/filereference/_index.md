## ItemOperationsFetchRequest.FileReference property

Specifies a unique identifier that is assigned by the server to each attachment. In an ItemOperations request, only one FileReference identifier can exist per Fetch. Violation of this constraint results in a Status element value of 2 being returned from the server. The client can, however, retrieve multiple attachments by using one Fetch node per attachment.

```csharp
public string FileReference { get; set; }
```

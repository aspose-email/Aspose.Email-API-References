| [CollectionId](collectionid) { get; set; } | Identifies the folder that was fetched. |
| [FileReference](filereference) { get; set; } | Specifies a unique identifier that is assigned by the server to each attachment. In an ItemOperations request, only one FileReference identifier can exist per Fetch. Violation of this constraint results in a Status element value of 2 being returned from the server. The client can, however, retrieve multiple attachments by using one Fetch node per attachment. |

| [RemoveRightsManagementProtection](removerightsmanagementprotection) { get; set; } | If present or true, it indicates that the client is removing the IRM protection from the e-mail. IRM protection can only be removed from e-mail messages when the ExportAllowed element is set to TRUE. |

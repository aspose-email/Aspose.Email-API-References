## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SmartRequest](smartrequest)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AccountId](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/smartrequest/accountid) { get; set; } | Identifies the account from which an email is sent. If the AccountId is null, the server sends the email using the account identified by the settings:PrimarySmtpAddress returned in the Settings command response. If AccountId is included in the request, the value MUST equal one of the settings:AccountId element values included in the Settings command response. The server MUST validate that the AccountId element value provided is valid for sending email. A Status value of 166 is returned if the AccountId element value is not valid. A Status element value of 167 is returned if the account does not support sending email. Note The server sends the email using the account specified by the AccountId, and not the account specified by the From. The AccountId element is not supported when the protocol version is 12.1 or 14.0. Exchange 2007 returns Status value 103 if the AccountId element is included in a SendMail command request, a SmartForward command request, or a SmartReply command request. |
| [ClientId](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/smartrequest/clientid) { get; set; } | Specifies the client's unique message ID (MID). The ClientId value can be up to 40 characters in length and MUST be unique for each message, as the server will use the ClientId value to identify duplicate messages. The ClientId value can be a simple counter incremented for each new message. |
| [Mime](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/smartrequest/mime) { get; set; } | Contains the MIME-encoded message. The Mime content is transferred as an opaque BLOB within the WBXML tags, as specified in [WBXML1.2]. If the message contains a meeting request, the Mime element contains the details of meeting in iCalendar format [MS-OXCICAL] or Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) format [MS-OXTNEF]. As specified in [RFC2447] section 3.4, iCalendar meeting requests have a content type of "text/calendar" with the method parameter set to "REQUEST". |
| [ReplaceMime](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/smartrequest/replacemime) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the client is sending the entire message. When the ReplaceMime is TRUE, the server MUST not include the body or attachments of the original message being forwarded. When the ReplaceMime is FALSE, the client MUST append the body of the original message as attachments to the outgoing message. The client can use this property to indicate whether the message was edited inline, or whether the message had reply/forward text prepended to the source message. If the ReplaceMime is TRUE, the message was edited. |
| [SaveInSentItems](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/smartrequest/saveinsentitems) { get; set; } | Specifies whether a copy of the message will be stored in the Sent Items folder. |
| [Source](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/smartrequest/source) { get; set; } | Contains information about the source message. |
| [TemplateID](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/smartrequest/templateid) { get; set; } | Contains a string that identifies the rights policy template represented by the parent RightsManagementLicense element. |

## SearchRequestStore.Query property

Specifies the keywords to use for matching the entries in the store that is being searched. The value of the Query is used as a prefix-string matching pattern, and returns entries that match the beginning of the string. For example, searching for "John" would match "John Frum" or "Barry Johnson", but would not match "James Littlejohn". All nonempty text properties in the GAL that are indexed by using ANR are compared with the Query element value. Search comparisons are performed by using case-insensitive matching. For a Windows SharePoint Services document library search, this protocol supports queries of the following form: LinkId == value, where value specifies the URL of the item or folder and LinkId indicates that the value is to be compared to the link ID property. For mailbox search, the query syntax is as follows: - Folders can be specified in the following ways: Specified ID Specified folder and subfolders All email folders, including Draft, Inbox and subfolders, Outbox, and Sent Items - The basic keyword query can be composed of the following: The basic operator: And (section 2.2.3.10) A dateTime filter specified by using the GreaterThan (section 2.2.3.78) and LessThan elements (section 2.2.3.87) FreeText elements (section 2.2.3.73) that contain keywords The basic keyword query is executed against all indexed properties.

```csharp
public SearchQuery Query { get; set; }

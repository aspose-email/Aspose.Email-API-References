## BodyPreference class

Contains preference information related to the type and size of information that is returned from searching, synchronizing, or fetching.

```csharp
public class BodyPreference
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BodyPreference](bodypreference)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AllOrNone](allornone) { get; set; } | A client can include multiple BodyPreference elements in a command request with different values for the Type element (section 2.2.2.22.4). By default, the server returns the data truncated to the size requested by TruncationSize for the Type element that matches the native storage format of the item's Body element. But, if the client also includes the AllOrNone element with a value of TRUE along with the TruncationSize element, it is instructing the server not to return a truncated response for that type when the size (in bytes) of the available data exceeds the value of the TruncationSize element. For example, a client can use these two elements to signify that it cannot process partial Rich Text Format (RTF) data (a Type element value of 3). In this case, if the client has specified multiple BodyPreference elements, the server selects the next BodyPreference element that will return the maximum amount of body text to the client. Assume that the client specifies two BodyPreference elements. If the AllOrNone element is not defined, then the truncated or non-truncated content is searched, synchronized, or retrieved as if the value was set to FALSE. |
| [Preview](preview) { get; set; } | Specifies the maximum length of the Unicode plain text message or message part preview to be returned to the client. This property MUST have a value set from 0 to 255, inclusive. |
| [TruncationSize](truncationsize) { get; set; } | Specifies the size which is used by a server to truncate returned data. The maximum value for TruncationSize is 4,294,967,295. If the TruncationSize element is not defined, the entire content is used for the request. |
| [Type](type) { get; set; } | Specifies the format type of the body content of the item. |

## RightsManagementLicense.EditAllowed property

Specifies whether the content of the original email can be modified by the user when the user forwards, replies, or replies all to the email message. The value is TRUE if the e-mail can be modified by the user; otherwise, FALSE. A value of FALSE requires that the client MUST exclude the original rights-managed email message from the SmartForward or SmartReply request. Consequently, inline replies are not allowed if the EditAllowed element is set to FALSE. When EditAllowed is set to FALSE and ReplaceMime is not present in a SmartForward or SmartReply request, the server will add the original rights-managed email message as an attachment to the new message. Conversely, if composemail:ReplaceMime is present, the server will not attach the original rights-managed email message as an attachment.

```csharp
public bool EditAllowed { get; set; }
```

## SearchResponseStore.Range property

Specifies the number of matching entries that are being returned. The format of the Range element value is in the form of a zero-based index specifier, formed with a zero, a hyphen, and another numeric value: "m-n." The m indicates the lowest index of a zero-based array that would hold the items. The n indicates the highest index of a zero-based array that would hold the items. For example, a Range element value of 0–9 indicates 10 items, and 0–10 indicates 11 items. A Range element value of 0–0 indicates 1 item. If Range is null, the default Range value for each Store type is used. The following table identifies the default Range values and maximum results returned for each Store type: Mailbox - Default range value: 0-99 - Maximum results returned: 100 DocumentLibrary - Default range value: 0-999 - Maximum results returned: 1000 GAL - Default range value: 0-99 - Maximum results returned: 100 If the Range value specified in the request exceeds the default range value, a Status value of 12 is returned to indicate that the maximum range has been exceeded. In the Search command response, the Total property indicates an estimate of the total number of entries that matched the Query value. Search results are stored in a search folder on the server. This way, when a client comes back with the same query but a new row range, rows are pulled from the result set that is currently stored in the search folder. The entire result set does not have to be rebuilt.

public string Range { get; set; }

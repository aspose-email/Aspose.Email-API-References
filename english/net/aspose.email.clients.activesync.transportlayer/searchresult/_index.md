## SearchResult class

Container for an individual matching mailbox item. When the store that is being searched is the mailbox: - There is one Result element for each match that is found in the mailbox. If no matches are found, an empty Result element is present in the Store container element of the response XML. - Inside the Result element, the Properties element contains a list of requested properties for the mailbox item. When the store that is being searched is the document library: - The first result that is returned in the Search response is the metadata for the Root folder or item to which the LinkId value is pointing. The client can choose to ignore this entry if it does not require it. - If the documentlibrary:LinkId element value in the request points to a folder, the metadata properties of the folder are returned as the first item, and the contents of the folder are returned as subsequent results. The Range applies to these results with no difference; for example, the index 0 would always be for the root item to which the link is pointing. - If the documentlibrary:LinkId element value in the request points to an item, only one result is returned: the metadata for the item. - Inside the Result element, the Properties element contains a list of requested properties for the mailbox item.

## Constructors

| Name | Description |

| [SearchResult](searchresult)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Class](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/searchresult/class) { get; set; } | Identifies the class of the item. |
| [CollectionId](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/searchresult/collectionid) { get; } | Specifies the folders in which the item was found. |
| [LongId](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/searchresult/longid) { get; set; } | Specifies a unique identifier that is assigned by the server to each result set that is returned. The value of the LongId can be used as the long ID specified in the ItemOperations command request, the SmartReply command request, the SmartForward command request, or the MeetingResponse command request to reference the result set. The client MUST store the value of LongId as an opaque string of up to 256 characters. |
| [Properties](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/searchresult/properties) { get; set; } | The Search command response Properties is a container for properties that apply to an individual entry that matches the Query element search string. For example, the Properties element contains an element for each nonempty, text-valued GAL property that is attached to the matching GAL entry. Only those properties that are attached to the specific GAL entry are returned; therefore different sets of properties can be returned in the response XML for different matching GAL entries. Each element in the Properties container is scoped to the appropriate namespace that is specified in the top-level Search element. |

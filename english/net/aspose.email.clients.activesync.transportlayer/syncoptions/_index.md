## SyncOptions class

Specifies options that control certain aspects of how the synchronization is performed.

```csharp
public class SyncOptions
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SyncOptions](syncoptions)() | Initializes a new instance of the SyncOptions class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BodyPartPreference](bodypartpreference) { get; } | Contains preference information related to the type and size of information that is returned from searching, synchronizing, or fetching a message part. |
| [BodyPreference](bodypreference) { get; } | Contains preference information related to the type and size of information that is returned from searching, synchronizing, or fetching. |
| [Class](class) { get; set; } | Specifies the class of the item being added to the collection. |
| [Conflict](conflict) { get; set; } | Specifies how to resolve the conflict that occurs when an object has been changed on both the client and the server. The value specifies which object—the client object or the server object—to keep if there is a conflict. If value is not defined, the server object will replace the client object when a conflict occurs. |
| [FilterType](filtertype) { get; set; } | Specifies an optional time window for the objects that are sent from the server to the client. |
| [MaxItems](maxitems) { get; set; } | Specifies the maximum number of recipients (that is, the top N most frequently used recipients) to keep synchronized from within the recipient information cache. This element MUST only be included in a request when the value of the CollectionId element (section 2.2.3.30.5) maps to the recipient information cache. The value of the MaxItems element does not specify the maximum estimate of additions and deletions to make to the recipient information cache, it only specifies the number of recipients to keep synchronized. A complete replacement of each recipient would be double the number of MaxItems or items in the store, as each recipient update requires a deletion and an addition. |
| [MIMESupport](mimesupport) { get; set; } | Enables MIME support for email items that are sent from the server to the client. |
| [MIMETruncation](mimetruncation) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the MIME data of the email item SHOULD be truncated when it is sent from the server to the client. |
| [RightsManagementSupport](rightsmanagementsupport) { get; set; } | Specifies how the server returns rights-managed email messages to the client. If the value of this element is TRUE, the server will decompress and decrypt rights-managed email messages before sending them to the client, as specified in section 3.2.4.3. If the value is FALSE (0), the server will not decompress or decrypt rights-managed email messages before sending them to the client. If the RightsManagementSupport element is not defined, a default value of FALSE is assumed. |

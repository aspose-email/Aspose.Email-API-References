## SyncOptions.MaxItems property

Specifies the maximum number of recipients (that is, the top N most frequently used recipients) to keep synchronized from within the recipient information cache. This element MUST only be included in a request when the value of the CollectionId element (section 2.2.3.30.5) maps to the recipient information cache. The value of the MaxItems element does not specify the maximum estimate of additions and deletions to make to the recipient information cache, it only specifies the number of recipients to keep synchronized. A complete replacement of each recipient would be double the number of MaxItems or items in the store, as each recipient update requires a deletion and an addition.

```csharp
public int? MaxItems { get; set; }
```

## SearchOptions.RightsManagementSupport property

Specifies how the server returns rights-managed email messages to the client. If the value is TRUE, the server will decompress and decrypt rights-managed email messages before sending them to the client. If the value is FALSE, the server will not decompress or decrypt rights-managed email messages before sending them to the client. If the RightsManagementSupport element is not included in a request message, a default value of FALSE is assumed.

```csharp
public bool? RightsManagementSupport { get; set; }
```

If the airsync:MIMESupport element is set to 'SendForSecureMIMEonly' (1) or 'SendForAll' (2) in the Search request: - The property of the airsyncbase:BodyPreference, the Type, SHOULD be included in the Search request, containing a value of 'MIME' (4) to inform the server that the device can read the MIME BLOB. - The response from the server MUST include the airsyncbase:Body, which is a child of the Properties. The airsyncbase:Body MUST contain the following properties in an S/MIME Search response: - The airsyncbase:Type with a value of 'MIME' (4) to inform the device that the data is a MIME BLOB. - The airsyncbase:EstimatedDataSize to specify the rough total size of the data. - The airsyncbase:Truncated to indicate whether the MIME BLOB is truncated. - The airsyncbase:Data that contains the full MIME BLOB.

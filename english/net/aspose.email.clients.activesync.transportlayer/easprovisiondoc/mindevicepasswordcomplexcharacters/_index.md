The character groups are defined as: Lower case alphabetical characters = 1 Lower case and Upper case alphabetical characters = 2 Lower case, Upper case alphabetical characters and Numbers = 3 Lower case and Upper case alphabetical characters, Numbers and Non-alphanumeric characters = 4 For example: If the value of MinDevicePasswordComplexCharacters is 2, a password with both upper case and lower case alphabetical characters would be sufficient, as would a password with lower case alphabetical characters and numbers.

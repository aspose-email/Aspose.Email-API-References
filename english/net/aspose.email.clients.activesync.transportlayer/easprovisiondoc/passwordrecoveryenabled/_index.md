second_title: Aspose.Email for .NET API Reference
description: Specifies whether the server supports storage of a recovery password to be sent by the client using the Settings command. A recovery password is a special password created by the client that gives the administrator or user the ability to log on to the device one time after which the user is required to create a new password. The client then creates a new recovery password. If the PasswordRecoveryEnabled is set to TRUE the server supports storage of a recovery password sent by the device. If the property is set to FALSE the device SHOULD NOT send a recovery password because the server does not support storage of the password. If PasswordRecoveryEnabled is null a client SHOULD treat this value as FALSE. If the value of the DevicePasswordEnabled is FALSE the client SHOULD ignore this property. This property SHOULD be ignored if the client does not support recovery passwords.

The DevicePasswordExpiration can be null, indicating that no password expiration policy is set. Valid values are listed bellow: = 0 - Passwords do not expire. &gt; 0 - Passwords expire in the specified maximum number of days. If DevicePasswordExpiration is null, a client SHOULD treat this value as 0. If the value of the DevicePasswordEnabled is set to FALSE, the client SHOULD ignore this property. |

The client SHOULD perform a local wipe or enter a timed lock out mode if the maximum number of failed password logon attempts is reached. The MaxDevicePasswordFailedAttempts can be null or have a value in the range from 4 through 16. If the property is null, the client interprets this as meaning that no maximum number of failed password logon attempts has been set by the security policy. If the value of the DevicePasswordEnabled is set to FALSE, the client ignores this property. |
| [MaxEmailAgeFilter](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/easprovisiondoc/maxemailagefilter) { get; set; } | Specifies the email age limit for synchronization. Valid values are listed bellow: Sync all 1 day 3 days 1 week 2 weeks 1 month |

| [MaxInactivityTimeDeviceLock](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/easprovisiondoc/maxinactivitytimedevicelock) { get; set; } | Specifies the maximum number of seconds of inactivity before the device locks itself. If this value is greater than or equal to 9999, the client interprets it as unlimited. If the MaxInactivityTimeDeviceLock is null, the client interprets this as meaning that no time device lock has been set by the security policy. |
| [MinDevicePasswordComplexCharacters](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/easprovisiondoc/mindevicepasswordcomplexcharacters) { get; set; } | Specifies the required level of complexity of the client password. The value specifies the number of character groups that are required to be present in the password. The character groups are defined as: Lower case alphabetical characters = 1 Lower case and Upper case alphabetical characters = 2 Lower case, Upper case alphabetical characters and Numbers = 3 Lower case and Upper case alphabetical characters, Numbers and Non-alphanumeric characters = 4 For example: If the value of MinDevicePasswordComplexCharacters is 2, a password with both upper case and lower case alphabetical characters would be sufficient, as would a password with lower case alphabetical characters and numbers. |
| [MinDevicePasswordLength](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/easprovisiondoc/mindevicepasswordlength) { get; set; } | Specifies the minimum client password length. The MinDevicePasswordLength can be empty or have a value no less than 1 and no greater than 16. If the property is null or the value of this property is 1, there is no minimum length for the device password. If the value of the DevicePasswordEnabled is FALSE, the client SHOULD ignore this property . |
| [PasswordRecoveryEnabled](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/easprovisiondoc/passwordrecoveryenabled) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the server supports storage of a recovery password to be sent by the client using the Settings command. A recovery password is a special password created by the client that gives the administrator or user the ability to log on to the device one time, after which the user is required to create a new password. The client then creates a new recovery password. If the PasswordRecoveryEnabled is set to TRUE, the server supports storage of a recovery password sent by the device. If the property is set to FALSE, the device SHOULD NOT send a recovery password, because the server does not support storage of the password. If PasswordRecoveryEnabled is null, a client SHOULD treat this value as FALSE. If the value of the DevicePasswordEnabled is FALSE, the client SHOULD ignore this property. This property SHOULD be ignored if the client does not support recovery passwords. |

| [RequireStorageCardEncryption](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/easprovisiondoc/requirestoragecardencryption) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the device encrypts content that is stored on the device. This property SHOULD be ignored if the client does not support storing data on removable storage. |
| [UnapprovedInROMApplicationList](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/easprovisiondoc/unapprovedinromapplicationlist) { get; } | Specifies a list of in-ROM applications that are not approved for execution.

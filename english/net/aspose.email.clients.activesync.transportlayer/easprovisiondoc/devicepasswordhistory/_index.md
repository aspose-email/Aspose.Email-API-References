## EASProvisionDoc.DevicePasswordHistory property

Specifies the minimum number of previously used passwords stored to prevent reuse by the client. Valid values are listed bellow: = 0 - Storage of previously used passwords is not required. &gt; 0 - The minimum number of previously used passwords to be stored. If DevicePasswordHistory is null, then a client SHOULD treat this value as 0. If the value of the DevicePasswordEnabled is set to TRUE, the client disallows the user from using a stored prior password after a password expires. If the value of the DevicePasswordEnabled is set to FALSE, the client SHOULD ignore this property.

public int? DevicePasswordHistory { get; set; }
```

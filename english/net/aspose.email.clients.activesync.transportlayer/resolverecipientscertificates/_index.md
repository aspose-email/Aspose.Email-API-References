| [CertificateCount](certificatecount) { get; set; } | Specifies the number of valid certificates that were found for the recipient. If a Status value of 8 is returned with the Certificates, the CertificateCount specifies the number of recipient certificates that were not returned. |
| [Certificates](certificates) { get; } | Contains the list of X509 certificates as binary large object (BLOB). This element is returned by the server only if the client specifies a value of 2 in the CertificateRetrieval in the ResolveRecipients command request. |
| [MiniCertificate](minicertificate) { get; set; } | Contains the mini-certificate BLOB. This element is returned only if the client specifies a value of 3 in the CertificateRetrieval in the ResolveRecipients command request and the resolved recipient has a valid S/MIME certificate. |
| [RecipientCount](recipientcount) { get; set; } | Specifies the number of members belonging to a distribution list. It can be used to determine whether all recipients belonging to a distribution list have valid certificates by comparing values of the CertificateCount and RecipientCount elements. |

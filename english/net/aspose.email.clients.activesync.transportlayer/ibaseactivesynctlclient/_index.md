## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AuthenticationType](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/authenticationtype) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the type of authentication is used by the ActiveSync client. |
| [AutodiscoverUri](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/autodiscoveruri) { get; set; } | Gets the autodiscover uri |
| [Credentials](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/credentials) { get; } | User's credentials for Exchange server |
| [DeviceID](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/deviceid) { get; set; } | A GUID that identifies the device. The device ID is specified by the device-id-spec ABNF rule portion of the plain text query value. The value, represented by the device-id ABNF rule, is a string that specifies the device. Each device MUST have a unique device ID string. Each request from the device MUST include the same device ID string. |
| [DeviceType](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/devicetype) { get; set; } | The device type is specified by the device-type-spec ABNF rule portion of the plain text query value. The value, represented by the device-type ABNF rule, is any string that specifies a device type. "SP" specifies a SmartPhone and "PPC" specifies a PocketPC. Other client devices send unique strings for their specific device type. Each request from a client device MUST include the same device type string. |
| [PolicyState](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/policystate) { get; set; } | An unsigned integer that indicates the state of policy settings on the client device, as specified in [MS-ASPROV] section 2.2.2.41. |
| [Proxy](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/proxy) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the proxy. |
| [SupportedServerCommands](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/supportedservercommands) { get; } | Gets the versions of ActiveSync commands which are server supported |
| [SupportedServerProtocols](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/supportedserverprotocols) { get; } | Gets the versions of ActiveSync protocols which are server supported |
| [Timeout](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/timeout) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of milliseconds to wait before the operation times out. The default value is 100,000 milliseconds (100 seconds). |
| [Uri](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/uri) { get; } | Gets the server uri |
| [UserAgent](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/useragent) { get; set; } | The User-Agent request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. This is for statistical purposes, the tracing of protocol violations, and automated recognition of user agents for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations. User agents SHOULD include this field with requests. The field can contain multiple product tokens (section 3.8) and comments identifying the agent and any subproducts which form a significant part of the user agent. By convention, the product tokens are listed in order of their significance for identifying the application. Example: User-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3 |
| [Version](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/version) { get; } | Gets the version of the protocol which is used in ActiveSync client. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |

| [Autodiscover](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/ibaseactivesynctlclient/autodiscover)(string) | The Autodiscover command facilitates the discovery of core account configuration information by using the user's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address as the primary input. |

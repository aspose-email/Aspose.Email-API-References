## IBaseActiveSyncTLClient.DeviceType property

The device type is specified by the device-type-spec ABNF rule portion of the plain text query value. The value, represented by the device-type ABNF rule, is any string that specifies a device type. "SP" specifies a SmartPhone and "PPC" specifies a PocketPC. Other client devices send unique strings for their specific device type. Each request from a client device MUST include the same device type string.

```csharp
public string DeviceType { get; set; }
```

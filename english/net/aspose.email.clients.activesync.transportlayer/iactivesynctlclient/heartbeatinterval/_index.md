## IActiveSyncTLClient.HeartbeatInterval property

The HeartbeatInterval element is a child element of the Ping element in Ping command requests and responses. In Ping command requests, it specifies the length of time, in seconds, that the server SHOULD wait before sending a response if no new items are added to the specified set of folders, as specified in section 3.1.5.6. The HeartbeatInterval element is also returned by the server with a status code of 5 and specifies either the minimum or maximum interval that is allowed when the client has requested a heartbeat interval that is outside the acceptable range.

```csharp
public int HeartbeatInterval { get; set; }
```

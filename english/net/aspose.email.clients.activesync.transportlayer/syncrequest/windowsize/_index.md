## SyncRequest.WindowSize property

Specifies a maximum number of changed items in a collection or a request that SHOULD be included in the synchronization response. The maximum value for the WindowSize is 512. However, if the WindowSize is set to 512, the server can send Sync response messages that contain less than 512 updates. If the server does not send all the updates in a single message, the Sync response message contains the MoreAvailable, which indicates that there are additional updates on the server to be downloaded to the client. The WindowSize appears only in requests that are sent to the server from the client. If the WindowSize is omitted, the server behaves as if a WindowSize element with a value of 100 were submitted. The server interprets the value 0 (zero) and values above 512 as 512.

```csharp
public int? WindowSize { get; set; }
```

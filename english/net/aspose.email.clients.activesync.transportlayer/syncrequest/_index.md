## SyncRequest class

Contains Sync request parameters

```csharp
public class SyncRequest
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SyncRequest](syncrequest)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Collections](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/syncrequest/collections) { get; } | Contains list of objects with commands and options that apply to a particular collection. |
| [HeartbeatInterval](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/syncrequest/heartbeatinterval) { get; set; } | Specifies the number of seconds that the server SHOULD delay a response if no new items are added to the included folders. Valid values for HeartbeatInterval are 60 through 3540 seconds (59 minutes). When the client requests an interval that is outside the acceptable range, the server will send a response that includes a Status value of 14 and a Limit element. Either the HeartbeatInterval or the Wait can be included in a Sync command request, but not both. If both elements are included, the server response will contain a Status value of 4. |
| [Partial](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/syncrequest/partial) { get; set; } | Indicates to the server that the client sent a partial list of collections, in which case the server obtains the rest of the collections from its cache. |
| [Wait](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/syncrequest/wait) { get; set; } | Specifies the number of minutes that the server SHOULD delay a response if no new items are added to the included folders. Valid values for the Wait are 1 through 59. When the client requests a wait interval that is outside the acceptable range, the server will send a response that includes a Status value of 14 and a Limit. Either the Wait or the HeartbeatInterval can be included in a Sync command request, but not both. If both are included, the server response will contain a Status value of 4. |
| [WindowSize](../../aspose.email.clients.activesync.transportlayer/syncrequest/windowsize) { get; set; } | Specifies a maximum number of changed items in a collection or a request that SHOULD be included in the synchronization response. The maximum value for the WindowSize is 512. However, if the WindowSize is set to 512, the server can send Sync response messages that contain less than 512 updates. If the server does not send all the updates in a single message, the Sync response message contains the MoreAvailable, which indicates that there are additional updates on the server to be downloaded to the client. The WindowSize appears only in requests that are sent to the server from the client. If the WindowSize is omitted, the server behaves as if a WindowSize element with a value of 100 were submitted. The server interprets the value 0 (zero) and values above 512 as 512. |

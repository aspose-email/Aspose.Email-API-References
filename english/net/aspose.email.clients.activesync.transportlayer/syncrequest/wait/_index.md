## SyncRequest.Wait property

Specifies the number of minutes that the server SHOULD delay a response if no new items are added to the included folders. Valid values for the Wait are 1 through 59. When the client requests a wait interval that is outside the acceptable range, the server will send a response that includes a Status value of 14 and a Limit. Either the Wait or the HeartbeatInterval can be included in a Sync command request, but not both. If both are included, the server response will contain a Status value of 4.

```csharp
public int? Wait { get; set; }
```

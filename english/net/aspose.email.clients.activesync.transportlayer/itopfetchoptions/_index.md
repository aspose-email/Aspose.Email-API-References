| [Range](range) { get; set; } | Specifies the range of bytes that the client can receive in response to the Fetch operation for a document library item. The Range element is an optional field. The Range element contains a string value in the format M-N, where M is less than N, and M is the minimum value and N is the maximum value. The byte range is zero-indexed; the first byte is indicated by a 0 (zero). If the Range is omitted in the Fetch request, the whole item is fetched. If the FileReference is present in the request, then the Range element is the only valid child element of the Options element. |
| [RightsManagementSupport](rightsmanagementsupport) { get; set; } | Specifies how the server returns rights-managed email messages to the client. If the value of this element is TRUE, the server will decompress and decrypt rights-managed email messages before sending them to the client, as specified in section 3.2.4.3. If the value is FALSE (0), the server will not decompress or decrypt rights-managed email messages before sending them to the client. If the RightsManagementSupport element is not defined, a default value of FALSE is assumed. |
| [Schema](schema) { get; } | Specifies the schema of the item to be fetched. The Schema is supported within options for PIM Fetch (section 2.2.3.63.1) requests. It is not supported when the client is retrieving items from a document library or retrieving an attachment. If the Schema element is not specified, the server allows all properties to be retrieved. |
| [UserName](username) { get; set; } | Specifies the username of the account leveraged to fetch the desired item. The UserName value can be up to 100 characters in length. |

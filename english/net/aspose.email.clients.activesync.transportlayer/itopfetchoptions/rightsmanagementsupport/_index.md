## ItOpFetchOptions.RightsManagementSupport property

Specifies how the server returns rights-managed email messages to the client. If the value of this element is TRUE, the server will decompress and decrypt rights-managed email messages before sending them to the client, as specified in section 3.2.4.3. If the value is FALSE (0), the server will not decompress or decrypt rights-managed email messages before sending them to the client. If the RightsManagementSupport element is not defined, a default value of FALSE is assumed.

```csharp
public bool? RightsManagementSupport { get; set; }
```

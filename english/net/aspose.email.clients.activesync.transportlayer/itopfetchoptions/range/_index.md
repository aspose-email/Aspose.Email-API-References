## ItOpFetchOptions.Range property

The byte range is zero-indexed; the first byte is indicated by a 0 (zero). If the Range is omitted in the Fetch request, the whole item is fetched. If the FileReference is present in the request, then the Range element is the only valid child element of the Options element.

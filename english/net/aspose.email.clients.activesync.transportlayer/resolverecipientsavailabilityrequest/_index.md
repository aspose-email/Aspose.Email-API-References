## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ResolveRecipientsAvailabilityRequest](resolverecipientsavailabilityrequest)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EndTime](endtime) { get; set; } | Identifies the end of the span of free/busy time requested by the client. The EndTime is not supported when the protocol version is 12.1. If the client sends an invalid EndTime value, then the server returns a Status value of 5 in the ResolveRecipients command response. If no EndTime is included in an Availablity request, the server uses a default end time value of seven days after the StartTime value. If the EndTime value specified in the request is smaller than the StartTime value plus 30 minutes, or the duration spanned by the StartTime value and the EndTime value is greater than a specific number of days, then the server returns a Status value of 5 in the ResolveRecipients command response. Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2013 use 42 days; Exchange 2007 SP1 uses 62 days. |
| [StartTime](starttime) { get; set; } | Identifies the start of the span of free/busy time requested by the client. The StartTime is not supported when the protocol version is 12.1. If the Availability is included in the request, the request MUST also include the StartTime and EndTime. If the client sends an invalid StartTime value, then the server returns a Status value of 5 in the ResolveRecipients command response. |

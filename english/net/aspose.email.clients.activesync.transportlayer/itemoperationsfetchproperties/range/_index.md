## ItemOperationsFetchProperties.Range property

Specifies the range of bytes that the client can receive in response to the Fetch operation for a document library item. The Range element contains a string value in the format m-n, where m less than n, and m is the minimum value and n is the maximum value. The byte range is zero-indexed; the first byte is indicated by a 0 (zero). If the Range element is omitted in the Fetch request, the whole item is fetched.

```csharp
public string Range { get; set; }
```

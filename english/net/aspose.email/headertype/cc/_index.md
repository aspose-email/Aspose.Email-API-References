## HeaderType.CC property

This header can be considered an extension of the "To:" field as it is used to specifiy additional recipients. In this case, the copy of an e-mail message sent to a recipient has the recipient's address appearing in the message. This is useful if you want to copy a message to many people with each of them seeing who the other recipients are; contrast with Bcc above. This header does appear in incoming e-mail. Exmple: Cc: gboyd@netcom.com

```csharp
public static HeaderType CC { get; }
```

## HeaderType.From property

This field contains the identity of the person(s) who wished this message to be sent. The message-creation process should default this field to be a single, authenticated machine address, indicating the AGENT (person, system or process) composing the message. If this is not done, the "Sender:" field MUST be present. If the "From:" field IS defaulted this way, the "Sender:" field is optional and is redundant with the "From:" field. Example: From: "Mr. Some One" someone@somedomain.com

```csharp
public static HeaderType From { get; }
```

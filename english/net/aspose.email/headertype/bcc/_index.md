## HeaderType.Bcc property

A copy of the e-mail message that is sent to one or more recipients without the knowledge of the primary recipients. Primary recipients are listed in the To: and Cc: lines. This is useful if you want to copy a message to many people without each of them seeing who the other recipients are. If you see this header on incoming mail, something is wrong because it does not appear in the headers.

```csharp
public static HeaderType Bcc { get; }
```

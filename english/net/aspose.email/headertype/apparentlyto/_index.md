## HeaderType.ApparentlyTo property

Inserted by sending e-mail when there is no "To:" recipient in the original message. This causes the recipients derived from the envelope to be listed in the message heading. This behavior is not quite proper, MTAs should not modify headers (except inserting Received lines), and it can in some cases cause Bcc recipients to be wrongly divulged to non-Bcc recipients. Example: Apparently-To: someone@somedomain.com Non-standard header that is discouraged in use, mentioned in RFC1211.

```csharp
public static HeaderType ApparentlyTo { get; }
```

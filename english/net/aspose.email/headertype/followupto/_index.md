## HeaderType.FollowupTo property

Used in Usenet News to indicate that future discussions (=follow-up) on an article should go to a different set of newsgroups than the replied-to article. The most common usage is when an article is posted to several newsgroups, and further discussions is to take place in only one of them. Defined in RFC 1036: 2.2.3, not standardized for use in e-mail.

```csharp
public static HeaderType FollowupTo { get; }
```

## MsgLoadOptions.PreserveTnefAttachments property

Controls loading TNEF attachment behaviour. By default the value is false.

```csharp
public bool PreserveTnefAttachments { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

If a message contains a TNEF attachment (winmail.dat), then this property defines whether files from TNEF will be decoded and extracted. The winmail.dat attachment remains as it is if the property value is true.

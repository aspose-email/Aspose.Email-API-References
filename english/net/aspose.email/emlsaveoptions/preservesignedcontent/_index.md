## EmlSaveOptions.PreserveSignedContent property

Gets or sets a value indicating whether it is necessary to save signed message without changes of content to provide correctly structure of digital sign. By default the value is false.

```csharp
public bool PreserveSignedContent { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The property is only meaningful for signed messages; it has no effect on unsigned messages. This property is intended for some complex signed messages with detached signature generated by other clients, whose implementation differences prevent Aspose.Email from exactly replicating their MIME content generation. Saving such messages without using PreserveSignedContent will cause the signature in the saved messages to fail. Some simple messages and messages with an attached signature can be saved correctly without using this property.

## ExchangeMessageInfo.InternalDate property

The internal date and time of the message on the server. This is not the date and time in the [RFC-2822] header, but rather a date and time which reflects when the message was received. - In the case of messages delivered via [SMTP], this SHOULD be the date and time of final delivery of the message as defined by[SMTP]. - In the case of messages delivered by the IMAP4rev1 COPY command, this SHOULD be the internal date and time of the source message. - In the case of messages delivered by the IMAP4rev1 APPEND command, this SHOULD be the date and time as specified in the APPEND command description. - All other cases are implementation defined.

```csharp
public virtual DateTime InternalDate { get; }
```

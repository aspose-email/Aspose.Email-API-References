## Identity class

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/identity?view=graph-rest-1.0 The Identity resource represents an identity of an actor. For example, an actor can be a user, device, or application.

```csharp
public class Identity
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Identity](identity)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DisplayName](../../aspose.email.clients.graph/identity/displayname) { get; set; } | The identity's display name. Note that this may not always be available or up to date. For example, if a user changes their display name, the API may show the new value in a future response, but the items associated with the user won't show up as having changed when using delta. |
| [Id](../../aspose.email.clients.graph/identity/id) { get; set; } | Unique identifier for the identity. |
| [Thumbnails](../../aspose.email.clients.graph/identity/thumbnails) { get; set; } | The ThumbnailSet resource is a keyed collection of thumbnail resources. |

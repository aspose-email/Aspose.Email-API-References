## SocksVersion enumeration

Versions of the SOCKS protocol

```csharp
public enum SocksVersion : byte
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SocksV4 | `4` | SOCKS4 and SOCKS4a version SOCKS4a extends the SOCKS4 protocol to allow a client to specify a destination domain name rather than an IPv4 address; this is useful when the client itself cannot resolve the destination host's domain name to an IP address. |
| SocksV5 | `5` | SOCKS5 version The SOCKS5 protocol is defined in RFC 1928. It is an extension of the SOCKS4 protocol; it offers more choices for authentication, and adds support for IPv6 and UDP, the latter of which can be used for DNS lookups. |

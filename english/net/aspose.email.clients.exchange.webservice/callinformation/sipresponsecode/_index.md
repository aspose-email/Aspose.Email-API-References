## CallInformation.SIPResponseCode property

SIP response code This list details all the SIP response codes defined in IETF RFCs and registered with the IANA as of 18 April 2013. It also includes SIP response codes defined in obsolete SIP RFCs (specifically, RFC 2543), which are therefore not registered with the IANA; these are explicitly noted as such. 1xx—Provisional Responses 2xx—Successful Responses 3xx—Redirection Responses 4xx—Client Failure Responses 5xx—Server Failure Responses 6xx—Global Failure Responses

```csharp
public int SIPResponseCode { get; }
```

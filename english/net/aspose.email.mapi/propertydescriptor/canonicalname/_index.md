## PropertyDescriptor.CanonicalName property

The name used to refer to the property in the documentation. The prefix of the canonical name identifies the basic characteristics of a property to the implementer. The canonical naming structure uses three categories that are denoted by the following prefixes to the canonical property name: * PidLid prefix: Properties identified by an unsigned 32-bit quantity along with a property set. * PidName prefix: Properties identified by a string name along with a property set. * PidTag prefix: Properties identified by an unsigned 16-bit quantity.

```csharp
public string CanonicalName { get; }
```
